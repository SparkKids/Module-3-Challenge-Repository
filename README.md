## Description
Password Generator. This application generates a random password based on user entered criteria. When the page loads a  box with the words "Your Secure Password" displays. Below the box is a red Generate Password button. When the user click on "Generate Password" the user is asked the following questions before generating a password:
1. "How long do you want your password to be?" if the user enters a number not between 8 & 128 or enters a non-numeric response, an error message is displayed and a new password is not generated.
2. Include lowercase characters? Y/N
3. Include uppercase characters? Y/N
4. Include numeric characters? Y/N
5. Include special characters? Y/N
If the user does not answer Y to at least one question (2 - 5) above, an error message is displayed and a new password is not generated.
